# GANs
This repo contains implementations of different different GANs. This implementations are part of the "Learning Generative Models" course that I took on summer 2020 at OvGU Magdeburg. Besides my efforts to do these assignments the code is adapted from ideas of fellow students and our respected Tutor. <br>
Since the ipynb file become very very big with the the outputs included, I have uploaded only the code. Part of generated images can be found below.
### 1. GAN 
This model trained for 25000 steps on cifar10 dataset. <br>

### 2. Wasserstein GAN
This model trained for 10000 steps on mnist dataset<br>

<br> and 25000 steps on street view house number (SVNH) dataset<br>
